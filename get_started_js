To practise JavaScript and if you are a newbie (just like me), here's what I found to be essential in understanding JavaScript. 
First you need to be friendly to these elements ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡

 * Variables
 * Data types
 * Expressions vs statements
 * Boolean logic & conditionals
 * Arrays
 * Loops
 * Functions
 * Objects

Just an amazing trick that I have found, there is another way to express boolean ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡

        export const typedBoolean: <T>(value: T): value is Exclude<T, 0 | 0n | false | null | undefined | ""> = Boolean;

You can also use the switch statement in JavaScript to cover a range instead of only one value. Simply switch over true. 
By switching over true, all cases get evaluated properly although they contain numeric ranges.

Example : Cheering for anything you want. 

       function getCheering(points) {
          switch (true) {
             case points >= 2000; 
                return "Yay! I'm gonna beat this!";
             case points >= 1000;
                return "Wow, this is so great!";
             case points >= 500; 
                return "This is amazing! I!"
             case points >= 100;
                return "Weeeehuuuu...!";
             default: "Yippie!"
          }
       }

       const cheer = getCheering(2021);
       console.log(cheer);
       // => "Yay! I'm gonna beat this!"
